            <div class="entry">
                <h3>Stanford AI Laboratory Cybench (2025) Percy Liang and Dan Boneh</h3>
                <p>Built offensive and defensive cybersecurity task environments for CyBench & BountyBench, a benchmark for
evaluating LLM cybersecurity capabilities. Developed AI agent workflows to decompose complex cybersecurity tasks into
detect, exploit, and patch sub-processes. Integrated real-world bug bounty data to assess AI agent impact in
cybersecurity applications. Research findings published in NeurIPS 2025.</div>
            <div class="entry">
                <h3>Stanford Brains in Silicon Lab (2024) Kwabena Boahen</h3>
                <p>Developed tools for DynaDojo, an open-source benchmark for ML algorithms on complex dynamical systems. Led the integration of 130+ new chaotic dynamical systems into DynaDojo for benchmarking ML models. Devised linear algebra-based methods for generating testing data. Presented research findings at the Stanford REU Conference in August.</p>

                <h3>Software Engineer - MirrorTab</h3>
                <p>Mirrortab is a small startup (< 20 people) focused on protecting users from browser-based cyber-attacks. As a software engineering intern, I led development of a cross-platform secure web browser to mitigate man-in-the-browser attacks targeting financial services. Coordinated across engineering, product, and marketing teams to formulate hypotheses, make demos, and iterated based on feedback. Built PoC malware to test MirrorTab's WebRTC pixel streaming defense technology.
