            <div class="entry">
                <h3>Stanford AI Laboratory (2025)</h3>
                <p>As part of Percy Leung & Dan Bonehâ€™s research team, helped develop BountyBench, a benchmark for evaluating the cybersecurity capabilities and risks of large language models. Engineered offensive and defensive cybersecurity task environments using containerized (Kali Linux) infrastructure. Integrated real-world bug bounty data, enabling quantification of AI agent performance by economic impact (dollar value) and advancing the assessment of autonomous AI in cybersecurity. Findings submitted to NeurIPS 2025.</p>

                <h3>Stanford Brains in Silicon Lab (2024)</h3>
                <p>Developed tools for DynaDojo, an open-source benchmark for ML algorithms on complex dynamical systems. Led the integration of 130+ new chaotic dynamical systems into DynaDojo for benchmarking ML models. Devised linear algebra-based methods for generating testing data. Presented research findings for faculty weekly and also at the Stanford REU Conference in August.</p>
