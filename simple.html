            <div class="entry">
                <h3>Stanford AI Laboratory (2025)</h3>
                <p>As part of Percy Leung & Dan Bonehâ€™s research team, helped develop BountyBench, a benchmark for evaluating the cybersecurity capabilities and risks of large language models. Engineered offensive and defensive cybersecurity task environments using containerized (Kali Linux) infrastructure. Integrated real-world bug bounty data, enabling quantification of AI agent performance by economic impact (dollar value) and advancing the assessment of autonomous AI in cybersecurity. Findings submitted to NeurIPS 2025.</p>
